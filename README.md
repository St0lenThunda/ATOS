# ATOS: A Thought Organization System
 
## System Overview

- a system for me to organize my thoughts.
- It is a visual tree, albeit upside down, that simulates my thinking patterns and logic systems.
- It is an ever-evolving project that I hope to be working on the day I leave.


## System Features:
- Simple file system structure for visualizing my essence to the most frivolous whims
- Drill down based on ST Logic
- The system works by "BubblenÂ  my categories naturally to the top".
